The whole self-esteem movement taught us erroneously that praising intelligence, talent, abilities would foster
self-confidence, self-esteem, and everything great would follow. But we’ve found it backfires. People who are praised
for talent now worry about doing the next thing, about taking on the hard task, and not looking talented, tarnishing
 that reputation for brilliance. So instead, they’ll stick to their comfort zone and get really defensive when they
  hit setbacks.
So what should we praise? The effort, the strategies, the doggedness and persistence, the grit people show,
the resilience that they show in the face of obstacles, that bouncing back when things go wrong and knowing
what to try next. So I think a huge part of promoting a growth mindset in the workplace is to convey those
values of process, to give feedback, to reward people engaging in the process, and not just a successful outcome.
